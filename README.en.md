# Demosratio

[Leer en espaÃ±ol](README.md)

An online tool to verify compliance with political promises and decisions, fostering transparency and citizen participation.

## What problem does it solve?

Demosratio aims to solve the lack of transparency in politics, allowing citizens to be informed clearly and objectively about the promises of politicians and the decisions they make. The platform avoids the political filters of the current press, providing direct access to information and facilitating citizen participation.

## How does it work?

Demosratio collects and organizes information about the electoral promises of politicians and the decisions they make in government. Users can easily access this information, verify official sources, and participate in voting simulations.

## Features

- **Clear and accessible information**: Database with promises and decisions, linked to official sources.
- **Easy tracking**: Status of promises (fulfilled, unfulfilled, in progress) and results of decisions (approved, rejected, in progress).
- **Citizen participation**: Contribution of verifiable information, reports of manipulation, and voting simulations.
- **Data visualization**: Interactive graphs and tables to analyze information.
- **Website sections**:
  - Homepage: Cards to show recent promises and decisions.
  - Votes in congress: Decisions sorted by date. With search by file text.
  - Electoral promises: Promises and decisions grouped by topics.
  - Data visualization: Interactive graphs and tables, when votes are clicked.
  - Manifesto: Information about the project and its creators.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Typescript
- **Backend**: Next.js, Supabase
